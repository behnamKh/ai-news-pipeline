# AI News Pipeline

A microservices-based pipeline built with .NET and RabbitMQ to simulate AI-driven processing of news articles.  
This project demonstrates a modular, scalable architecture using message queues for decoupled service communication.

## âœ¨ Project Overview

The AI News Pipeline consists of several independent services that process news articles through various stages:

1. **News Fetcher** â€“ Simulates fetching raw news articles.
2. **Summarizer** â€“ Summarizes raw articles into concise text.
3. **Sentiment Analyzer** â€“ Analyzes the emotional tone of the summaries.
4. **Tagging Service** â€“ Tags articles based on content and sentiment.
5. **Storage Service** â€“ Saves the final processed output.

Each service communicates via RabbitMQ queues, forming a lightweight, event-driven architecture.
